# Czo Auto Complete

## Extension for Chromium and Firefox.

A long time ago, there was a web page that could not remember the password I had typed. This page had in its HTML an `<input name="foo" autocomplete="off">`. This extension allows you to put `autocomplete="on"` in the code of the HTML page. So like that, no more problems.

But I don't use it anymore today, knowing that web browsers, allow to save passwords.

But I keep this extension for old browsers...
